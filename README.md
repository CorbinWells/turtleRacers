# turtleRacers
A simple turtle racing game. <br />
In this game you bet on a turtle to win based on its color. You have five turtles to choose from, green, blue, red, purple, and yellow. 
<br />The core logic of the game is each turtle has a random chance to move forward between 0 and 20 steps, the first turtle to move forward 400 steps wins. 
This process is visualized using the turtle graphics module.
